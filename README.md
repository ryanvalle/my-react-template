# React Base Template...
Base react tempalte with webpack and support to compile css and js

## Setup
To run:
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`

## Files to look at
* Styling in the css directory
* Javascript assets in the js directory
* JS and CSS assets are compiled to `public/style.css` and `public/app.min.js`

## Note
Still learning react so there may be more optimal ways to do some of this...
